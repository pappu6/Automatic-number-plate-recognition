# Automatic-number-plate-recognition
Automatic number plate recognition using Deep Learning
Automatic Number Plate Recognition has a wide range of applications since the license number is the primary, most widely accepted, human readable, mandatory identifier of motor vehicles.
This project aims to recognize license number plates. In order to detect license number plates, we will use OpenCV to identify number plates and python pytesseract to extract characters and digits from the number plates.
asically this project use OpenCV is an open-source machine learning library and provides a common infrastructure for computer vision. Whereas Pytesseract is a Tesseract-OCR Engine to read image types and extract the information present in the image.
For implementing this project use OpenCV features like Gaussian Blur,Morphological Transformation and sobel.
